## idea

The idea is taken from [@JosXa](https://github.com/JosXa)'s
[botfather-cli](https://github.com/JosXa/botfather-cli) project.

Note that the code from this repository isn't by any means related
to his code, since this is an implementation from scratch using the
wonderful [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) library.
